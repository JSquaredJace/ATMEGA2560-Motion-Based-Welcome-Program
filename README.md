# ATMEGA2560-Motion-Based-Welcome-Program
Embedded C program for ATMEGA2560 created for CENG447 Final Project. ATMEGA2560 takes in information from a PIR motion sensor and outputs a signal to an LED and to an LCD screen and sends information to a computer over SSH. This is to simulate a home security system, where the PIR sensor and LED represent a motion sensing light, the LCD screen represents a home security panel interface, and the computer represents an alert system for the home owner.
